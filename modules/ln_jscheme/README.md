# LNjScheme

LNjScheme allows to call any Java/Android method from
lambdanative/gambit without additional JNI code.  Either directly or
within the UI thread (dispatched asynchronously via `runOnUiThread`).

## Build

call `make -f Makefile` in this directory to create `android_jars/LNjScheme.jar`.

## Usage

### Procedures

#### (`android-app-class`)

Returns a *string* naming the Android application class.

#### (`lnjscheme-future` *OBJ*)

Returns a `promise` for an (asynchronous evaluated) result of *OBJ* -
which must be a *S-expression* valid within jScheme.

This is the general way to call jScheme.  The *S-expression* is
evaluated via `runOnUiThread` in Android.  The caller is expected to
wait for the result in a Scheme thread.  The calling procedure (i.e.,
event handler) **MUST** return to allow Android to dispatch the
request **before** the returned *promise* is `force`d.

#### (`call-with-lnjscheme-result` *OBJ* **[** *RECEIVER* **]**)

Send *OBJ* to jScheme for evaluation.  *RECEIVER* is a 1ari procedure,
`force`by default, expecting a *promise*, which is invoked (from
another callback into lambdanative in the event loop) when the result
is available.

NOTE: This is a low level procedure, which *MAY* change.

# History

LNjScheme is derived from the 1.4 version of
[Jscheme from Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/jscheme.html).

Jscheme version 1.4, the last version that I released (in April
1998). A mercilessly small, easily modifiable version.

(NB: There is another thing going by the name Jscheme, which was
extented by a community until 2006.  This version grew beyond the
features, complexity and size which make the Peter Norvigs version
interesting as a starting point.)

Jscheme 1.4 however lacks a few features, notably the ability supply
arguments to constructors.  Therefore a derivative was required for
LN.  In accordance with the stated license for Jscheme it got a new
name.

JÃ¶rg F. Wittenberger (a.k.a. 08/15 -- known als 0-8-15 on githug)
initially added those features (C) 2019.

## Changes

1. Baseline: unpacked the sources from `jscheme-source.jar` into
   subdirectory `LNjScheme`.
2. Changed package name to LNjScheme and added Makefile.
3. Refined errors raised from application of Java methods.
4. Pulled some code from the community version to support constructors with arguments.
5. Copied glue code from experimental branch and rename identifiers.

# Issues

## Numbers

jScheme uses `lang.java.Double` for all numbers.  This does not play
nice with native Jave APIs.  TBD: Teach it either about fixnums or
conversion; or both.

## Missing

Really missing is the ability to access arbitrary field values (as
apposed to calling methods) of any class.

    import java.lang.reflect.Field;

     Field chap = c.getDeclaredField("chapters");
            out.format(fmt, "before", "chapters", book.chapters);
            chap.setLong(book, 12);
            out.format(fmt, "after", "chapters", chap.getLong(book));

    Field[] fields = c.getDeclaredFields();
            for (Field classField : fields)
            {
                result.add(classField);
            }
