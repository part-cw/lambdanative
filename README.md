## Introduction 
LambdaNative is an open-source (BSD licensed) cross-platform
development environment written in Scheme ([Gambit-C](https://github.com/feeley/gambit)), supporting
Android, iOS, BlackBerry 10, OS X, Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenWrt.

If you use the LambdaNative framework for your own work, please reference this [ICFP paper](http://ecem.ece.ubc.ca/~cpetersen/lambdanative_icfp13.pdf).
A slideshow describing the LambdaNative framework is available [here](https://github.com/part-cw/lambdanative/blob/master/docs/LambdaNative.pdf?raw=true).

`uSquish`, the simple example game included in the LambdaNative repository,
is available as a free download on the Apple and Google stores: [uSquish for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/usquish/id647308142) and [uSquish for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.bccw.usquish)
