# Introduction

LambdaNative is an open-source (BSD licensed) cross-platform
development environment written in Scheme (Gambit-C), supporting
Android, iOS, OS X, Linux, Windows and OpenBSD.

LambdaNative is actively developed and used at the
University of British Columbia by the Pediatric Anesthesia
Research Team for production of clinical mHealth
applications, including mission-critical embedded drug
delivery systems and telemonitoring apps for iPhone
and Android smartphones.  LambdaNative-based applications
have been used in clinical trials on >10,000 subjects in
Canada, France, India, Uganda, Bangladesh, and South
Africa, in >10 separate clinical studies:

If you use the LambdaNative framework for your own work, please reference this paper.

A slideshow describing the LambdaNative framework is available [here](https://github.com/part-cw/lambdanative/blob/master/docs/LambdaNative.pdf?raw=true).

`uSquish`, the simple example game included in the LambdaNative repository,
is available as a free download on the Apple and Google stores:

# Getting started

## Required SDKs

The minimum requirement for developing applications is the
presence of a working gcc compiler. In addition,
cross-compilation requires installation of the appropriate
environments:

### Android (mac or linux) 
Install the android SDK and NDK
under `/usr/local` and the API that you want to develop for.

### iOS (mac)
Install the iOS SDK under `/Developer` to develop iOS applications.

### Linux cross-compilation (mac)
Install a linux cross-compiler under `/usr/local` to create
linux binaries.

### Windows cross-compiler (mac or linux)
Install a windows cross-compiler under `/usr/local` to
create windows binaries.

### Windows development environment
If you are developing on a windows machine (not
recommended), install the MSYS development environment.

## Required tools

A number of tools are needed to support the framework.
Please ensure that these are installed on your system:

* `wget` for pulling library code from the net
* `freetype` for rendering vector fonts
* `netpbm` and `ImageMagick` for misc pixmap manipulation
* `ghostscript` for converting vector artwork
* `cmake` for generating XCode projects
* `latex` for generating string textures (actually uses the unicode `xelatex`)
* `tgif` for editing vector artwork (optional)
* `fruitstrap` for installing iOS apps (optional)

## SETUP and PROFILE

Use the provided `SETUP.template` and `PROFILE.template` to
create files `SETUP` and `PROFILE` in the framework
directory matching your setup.

## First build

To start using the framework, type:

    ./configure DemoHelloWorld
    make

this will take a while, as the supporting libraries are
downloaded and compiled for the first time. On completion,
you will have a binary for your local host.

On a suitably configured platform, you can now do:
    
    ./configure DemoHelloWorld android
    make

    ./configure DemoHelloWorld ios
    make

and binaries for the specified platforms will be built and
packaged.
