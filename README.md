## Introduction 
LambdaNative is an open-source (BSD licensed) cross-platform development environment written in Scheme ([Gambit-C](https://github.com/feeley/gambit)), supporting Android, iOS, BlackBerry 10, OS X, Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenWrt.

If you use the LambdaNative framework for your own work, please reference this [ICFP paper](http://ecem.ece.ubc.ca/~cpetersen/lambdanative_icfp13.pdf).
A slideshow describing the LambdaNative framework is available [here](https://github.com/part-cw/lambdanative/blob/master/docs/LambdaNative.pdf?raw=true).

The repository contains a number of [demonstration programs](apps), inlcuding the games [uSquish](apps/USquish) and [LineDrop](apps/LineDrop), and a [Calculator](apps/Calculator).
